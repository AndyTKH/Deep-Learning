# Deep-Learning 
Deep Learning (DL) is an advanced technique of machine learning (ML) based on neural network algorithm. This technique has found its application in almost every sector of business. Various deep learning models such as convolutional networks, recurrent networks, and GANs are implemented in the projects for trends prediction, image classification, and data generation.
