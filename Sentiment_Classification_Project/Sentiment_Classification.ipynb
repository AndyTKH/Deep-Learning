    "## Why We're here\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Language Processing is the study of human language using tools such as Machine Learning, or in this case Deep Learning. In this notebook, the Sentiment Classification Neural Network will take in human generated text as inputs and output the text with positive or negative label. Hence, the goal of the Neural Network is to discover the correlation between the input and output data. To find this correlation, we are required to curate our dataset for text inputs and label pairs, transform our textual input data into numerical form, increase signal and reduce noise in data set, increase efficiency in our neural network, train the neural network, and make accurate prediction. The functions below display sample output of this project. \n",

So if we train our neural network on the entire review, this will result in good correlation but poor in generalization. This leads to our theory of looking at how individual words might have correlation with these 'Positive' and 'Negative' labels. Use [Counter](https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.Counter) library for individual words counting. "

    "We want our neural network to train on signal, rather than noise. If we recall the `update_input_layer` function in our neural network, the input `self.layer_0` contains each word and its total counts, so how high this total counts number affects how dominantly its weights to all hidden layer nodes. For example if we run `review_counter.most_common()` to look at words that have most weights in the first review. It's unfortunate to see that `period/.` , `the`, `to` , and `i` words that have nothing to do with sentiment, have dominant effect in the hidden layer. These words are noise in the neural network and by counting each word seems to highlight the noise, rather than signal, making it harder for the neural network to find the signal for accurate prediction. To eliminate the noise, we could change the `update_input_layer`'s incrementing sign to equal to 1. For example from `self.layer_0[0][self.word2index[word]] += 1` to `self.layer_0[0][self.word2index[word]] = 1`.    "

    "After we eliminated the noise by getting rid of the total counts weighting, the neural network was able to find correlation so much faster with approximately 78% training accuracy just after 10% progress. Both the training accuracy and testing accuracy eventually reach up to 85%. This is a great improvement in the neural network's performance, simply done by increasing a signal and reducing the noise on the input data. Now, we are happy with our accuracy, in the next part, we will discuss how to improve the speed(reviews/sec).  "

    "Neural Network can train endlessly in any cases. However, the faster you get neural network to train, the more data you can put into it, hence, the stronger it can be. Notice from the image below, we are creating a huge vector on `layer_0` with zeros and ones. These zero vectors aren't doing anything and are wasteful computationally, so the idea is we find the indices with ones in `layer_0` , and use those indices in our `weights_0_1` , adding the weights to the `layer_1`, instead of performing the usual dot product between `layer_0` and weights for `layer_1`. We will see a simple example below.   "

    "We have successfully trained our neural network with movie review words to create high value for positive sentiment or low value for negative sentiment. Neural network backpropagate the gradients and update the input weights to be more accurate, for example the positive sentiment output is giving more weights to positive words because they are in the same phenomenon, and eventually similar words (good, excellent, awesome) with the same signal will end up congregating together with very similar vector to one another. Computationally, If we dot product of two similar words, we will get a high value, however if we dot product of two opposite words, this will result in a low value. The `most_similar_words` function below will take any word input and output 50 most similar words correspond to your input.\n",

This app may be improved by including more variety of input data that have more classification classes, for example training on neural network classification for different sports (football, basketball, volleyball), so that we could relate words correspond to each sports. If the neural network is built large enough, it will be a strong synonyms dictionary app to give you all related key words, given an input."
